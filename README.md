# Mage Modules
## Description
Sometimes I like to code a little something here and there to make my Magento life a little easier.

## Modules
### Advanced Template Hints (Coming soon...)
As a frontend developer, I don't know that I could live without the Template Hints.  However, despite it's usefulness, it's clunky to look at, doesn't always reveal
everything I am looking for (leaving me to guess at some things), 
and forget trying to test responsiveness with it.  This module aims to improve on the idea, but with a slightly more dynamic approach.  The borders will stay, 
but rather than blocks and classes being shoved into the current template, those necessary items will be moved to a tooltip dialogue.  Hover over a section, and 
the dialogue will fill with the names of the *.phtml and block class you are looking for.
    
More to come soon.

### CMS
Sample code to use for making data patches.  

### Reorder Config
As plugins get added in, the System -> Configuration tabs become a flyin' splat-form yuck-wad of a hot-mess.  This module re-orders the tabs so that 
the core Magento tabs are at the top, and the Advanced tab stays at the bottom.  3rd party plugins will (usually) be in-between, depending on their sort orders.
